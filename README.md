### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

This is the desktop version of the component. I didn't upload the mobile version cause it's too long.

## My process

I have built the layout using flexbox. The Hide/Show effect of answers on clicking questions is implemented using necessary css classes. I have used jQuery to add sliding animation and click events. The classes are toggled using jQuery. Added media queries to make the component responsive.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- jQuery
